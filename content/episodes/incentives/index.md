In this episode, we look under the hood of incentives—the seen and
unseen forces that quietly steer our choices. We explore explicit
rewards (bonuses, treats, "if I do X I get Y") and the subtler, socially
programmed incentives that keep us car-brained, over-consuming, lonely,
and stuck on the individualist treadmill. We talk car culture and
walkability, the myth of "more personal freedom = better," lawnmowers
and shared resources, consumerism as "the perfection of slavery," and
how all of this fuels burnout, anxiety, and environmental collapse. Then
we bring it back to the personal: how to notice the urges that move you,
align your incentives with your real values, and use tiny, intentional
"self-tricks" to choose connection, community, and a life that’s good
for both the bee *and* the hive.
