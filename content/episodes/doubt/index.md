Doubt isn't evidence that something is wrong with you; it's often a sign that
you're standing at the edge of growth, exposure, and transformation.

Doubt is a signal worth listening to. In this episode we explore doubt as a
fear-based safety strategy---tightening the body and spinning the mind.

From failed launches and lingering colds to Stoicism, gym metaphors, and
welcoming discomfort, this conversation reframes adversity as invitation. What
if the experiences you least prefer are also the ones strengthening your
capacity, deepening self-trust, and opening you to real connection? What if
doubt itself is a doorway---asking you not to retreat, but to lean in

This episode offers practices, reflections, and a compassionate reorientation
toward uncertainty, reminding you that you don't need perfection to trust
yourself… and that sometimes, the very cracks you're trying to hide are how
connection gets in.
