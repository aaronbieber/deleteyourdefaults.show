For all that we live in a world that pretends we’re rational beings
doing rational things, feelings drive everything in our lives, or block
everything. Developing the skill of feeling our feelings, allowing them
to move, expressing them healthily determines the quality of our
relationships, our creative output, our work product, and so much more.

We explore how our feelings can bring us wisdom and information the
brain can’t grasp or hold onto, the value of intuition, 

We mention [Joe Hudson](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArtofAccomplishment)
and his awesome coaching videos. [Here’s the specific one we refer
to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htYNDwMXZNU). [Here’s
another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11Pbk6WyqTU).

We also mention two breathwork apps:
[Pause](https://www.pausebreathwork.com) and
[Breathwrk](https://www.breathwrk.com).
