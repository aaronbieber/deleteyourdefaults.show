If you’re ready for friendships (and a life) that can hold truth, tenderness,
and growth—this one’s for you.

**Episode snapshot**

Rosa and Aaron unpack what we call **full-contact friendship**: relationships
where we stop performing, tell the truth, and meet each other in the gritty,
generous middle. You’ll hear about midlife “unraveling,” the comfort trap,
type-2 fun, and the inner work that makes vulnerability feel less like free-fall
and more like strength training for the soul.
