In this episode, Rosa and Aaron unpack why most “communication” isn’t—yet. We
explore trading “How are you?” for openings that spark real connection, explore
why “Does that make sense?” falls flat, and share practical moves like
reflection and slowing down to speed up. Along the way we touch on self-talk as
a performance enhancer, the limits of language, and the courage to keep
conversations open, curious, and kind.

We reference Delete Your Defaults favorites Alan Watts and Joe Hudson.
