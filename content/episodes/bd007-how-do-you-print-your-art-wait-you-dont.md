On trial in this episode is the spectrum of value in printing your digital works
onto, you know, actual paper.

We get into it: why don't people do slide shows anymore? Is printing the best
way to scrutinize your own art? What does it take to "really show up" for an art
fair?

Printing services we like:

-   [White House Custom Color](https://www.whcc.com/)
-   [Bay Photo](https://bayphoto.com/)
