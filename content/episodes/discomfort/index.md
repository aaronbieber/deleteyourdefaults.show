What if discomfort isn’t something to avoid—but an invitation into expansion,
aliveness, and self-trust?

In this episode, Rosa and Aaron dive into the strange, surprising terrain of
discomfort---anticipation, dread, exhilaration, growth---and what it means to
meet it with curiosity instead of resistance. From skydiving and long flights to
creative risks and self-talk, we explore why everything you want really *is* on
the other side of some new form of discomfort—and how to cross that threshold
with celebration rather than self-punishment.

You’ll hear:

  - Why **anticipated discomfort** is usually worse than the real thing

  - How **novel discomfort** (not familiar pain) is where growth actually
    happens

  - How to reframe dread as **excitement** and discomfort as **aliveness**

  - Why “experiments” and “mistakes” are the true markers of expansion

  - The danger of **proficiency fatalism** (and how to start anyway)

  - Practices for befriending discomfort: movement, reframing,
    self-encouragement, and awe

We're here to remind you that discomfort doesn’t stand in your way---it just
happens to be in front of you.
