All humans---including you!---are creative. And we all have creative processes,
though we aren\'t always aware of what they are.

In this conversation, we explore our creative processes, and barriers and
facilitators to creativity.

We mention a bunch of people, including:

* Gary Bernhardt
  of [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts)

* I credit Maya Angelou with the quote that you should let your failures refine
  you, not define you, but it turns out it was Max Lucado who said that.

* [Atomic Habits](https://archive.org/details/atomic-habits-by-james-clear.pdf)
  by [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/resources)

* [Louie Parkinson](https://www.youtube.com/@LouisParkinsonClimbing) also of
  [Catalyst Climbing](https://www.youtube.com/@CatalystClimbing)

* [Brene Brown](https://brenebrown.com) in reference to midlife \"unraveling\"

* [adrienne maree brown](http://adriennemareebrown.net/) and her quote that,
  \"Feeling good isn\'t frivolous; it\'s freedom.\"
