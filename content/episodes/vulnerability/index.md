This episode explores vulnerability as the core to full contact living, how
avoiding vulnerability is a way of trying to be in control and stay safe. But
what is safety? Protecting ourselves from life means protecting ourselves from
living.

Vulnerability is the courage of giving ourselves permission to BE ourselves out
loud, and in so doing, making ourselves available for real connection.

We explore resistance, attachment, and changing our minds.

We mention poet Andrea Gibson: check out their amazing work all over the
internet, and
