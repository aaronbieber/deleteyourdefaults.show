What if love isn't a feeling, but a verb---a set of actions, choices,
and ways of being?

In this episode, we take on one of the most loaded words in our
culture---**love**---and get underneath the defaults our culture hands
us about what it is and how it\'s supposed to look.

We explore reorienting toward love as an *action*, a *practice*, and
a *capacity for growth*---rather than a possession, performance, or
obligation.

Resources we mention:

    bell hooks---a foundational text reframing love as an ethic and a
    practice

-   [**The Road Less
    Traveled**](https://bookshop.org/a/118634/9780743243155)---source
    of the definition of love discussed in the episode

    approach to truth, grief, and relational integrity
