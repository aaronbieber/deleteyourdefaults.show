In this episode, we pull apart "perfection" from multiple angles: the
rigid, human version that freezes us in place, and the spacious,
spiritual sense that everything is already perfect as it is. We track
how perfectionism shows up as *proficiency fatalism* ("they're so good,
why should I even try?"), hidden competitiveness ("if I can't be sure
I'll win, I don't want to play"), and a deep avoidance of feelings
like disappointment and shame.

We talk about perfection as "the anti-try"---the thing that keeps you
out of the arena entirely---and contrast it with iteration, play, and
being willing to be bad at something (and even be *seen* being bad at
it) on the way to growth. Along the way, we explore growth vs fixed
mindset, how confidence is built by surviving failure rather than
racking up successes, and how self-kindness turns failures into compost
instead of evidence that you're broken.

We mention a bunch of our favorite people\! [Joe
Hudson](https://www.artofaccomplishment.com/), [Reverend angel Kyodo
williams](http://transformativechange.org/), Carol Dweck and her book
[Mindset](https://bookshop.org/p/books/mindset-the-new-psychology-of-success-carol-s-dweck/aaaba3bad0daa3a3?aid=118634&ean=9780345472328&listref=recommended-in-delete-your-defaults),
among others.

We close with a pair of invitations:

  - If perfection is a trap, what would make you feel more *free* in
    this moment?

  - And if perfection is a myth, what becomes possible when you stop
    waiting to feel "ready" and let yourself try, fail, learn, and try
    again?
