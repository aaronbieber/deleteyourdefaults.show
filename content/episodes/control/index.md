Let's dismantle one of our most seductive illusions: that we’re in control, and
that that's what makes us safe.

In this episode, we explore how control, expectations, disappointment, and
safety are intertwined. We get into what we *don’t* control (almost everything)
from what we *do* influence (ourselves). We dig into the fact that attempts to
control life often backfire—amplifying frustration, resentment, and
suffering—and that presence, humor, and self-responsibility tend to soften
experience and open up better outcomes.

The episode offers practical ways to “delete the default” of externalized
control: replacing *should* with *want*, giving yourself the reassurance you
seek from others, practicing believable self-talk, and meeting fear and
disappointment with compassion instead of resistance. Ultimately, this is a
conversation about letting go without giving up—recognizing that it often takes
more strength to release control than to cling to it, and that a meaningful life
includes falling off the wall, wiping out on the wave, and laughing at your own
humanity along the way.
