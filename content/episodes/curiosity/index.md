In this episode we explore curiosity as a way of being, as a practice
that softens defensiveness, loosens certainty, and reopens the doors
your nervous system has been calling "walls." We talk about how our
minds invent "facts" in order to maintain the comfortable illusion of
certainty, why being wrong is not a moral failure (it's freedom), and
how curiosity makes conflict, coaching, and real relationship possible.

If you've been feeling closed down, reactive, overly serious, or stuck
in "I already know," this conversation is an invitation to come back to
play, possibility, and the courage to ask a better question.
