In this episode, we unpack the slippery power of **expectations**—how they can
motivate, manipulate, cheer or demotivate. We tease apart expectations vs.
ambitions vs. intentions, explore why **unspoken expectations** are The Worst,
and offer body-based ways to feel the difference between attachment and
optimism. From rock-climbing mantras (“climb hard and have fun”) to
million-dollar-goal thought experiments, we keep circling one powerful
truth: **presence, agency, and clear standards beat future-tense attachment
every time.**

And we leave you with an invitation to explore your relationship to expectations
for yourself. For the next two weeks:

1.  **Notice** when an expectation appears.

2.  **Name it out loud or on paper and get curious about it.** Is it spoken? Is
    it yours?

3.  **Reframe it** to an **intention** (present, controllable) or
    an **ambition** (energizing, values-aligned).

4.  **Check in with your body:** Ask “What does this feel like?” Get to know
    your body's ways of communicating yes and no.

5.  **Journal briefly** each day to spot patterns and wins.
