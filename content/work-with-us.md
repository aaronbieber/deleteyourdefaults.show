The conversations on this show scratch the surface. If you're ready to go deeper---to actually examine the defaults running your life and start making deliberate choices---both of us work with people one-on-one.

## Aaron Bieber -- Coaching for Tech Professionals

Aaron partners with curious, motivated tech professionals---engineers, leads, managers, directors---to cut through career fog and create real momentum. Whether you're navigating a transition, stepping into leadership, or stuck in a role that no longer fits, Aaron helps you build a clear, actionable plan grounded in your own values.

His clients work at companies like Wayfair, HubSpot, and LinkedIn. One CTO described the experience as having "radically changed" their approach to leadership and problem solving.

Coaching is a true partnership: challenging, sometimes emotional, and deeply practical. Engagements are shaped around your goals and timeline.
