# Sailing on the waves of life: a practical guide to releasing control

![](waves-of-life.png)

"Sailing on the waves of life" is the practice of releasing your grip on
outcomes you can't actually control, and redirecting that energy toward being
fully present in the moment. It's recognizing when you're reaching for "control
strategies" to manufacture a feeling of safety, and instead finding ways to feel
genuinely safe while accepting life's fundamental uncertainty.

You have agency. You have influence. You can set your direction and adjust your
sails. But you can't control the waves—and trying to do so exhausts you while
preventing you from actually navigating skillfully.

If you detect parallels between these ideas and the teachings of Buddhism or
similar philosophical traditions, you're not wrong. Many of (especially) the
Eastern philosophies had this figured out thousands of years ago.

## Recognizing your control strategies

We all have reflexive patterns we use to create a sense of safety when facing
uncertainty. The two most common are:

### Planning/strategizing

Trying to map every contingency, research every possibility, or build elaborate
"if-then" scenarios for situations that haven't happened yet.

This can also include creating elaborate systems and routines and compulsive
information gathering or researching.

### Performing/role-playing

Crafting a carefully managed version of yourself to produce a specific reaction
or outcome from others. Seeking reassurance, leaning into hyper-independence,
people-pleasing, and fixing or caretaking are all ways we might seek
"performative safety."

These strategies feel productive. They feel like taking action. But here's the
paradox: they often don't work, and sometimes they create the exact outcome
you're trying to avoid.

## The two ironies of control

### Irony #1: control strategies often simply don't work.

Consider trying to plan for a difficult conversation with a friend about
something that hurt your feelings. You script what you'll say, anticipate their
responses, prepare counterpoints. But the conversation never follows your
script. They respond in ways you didn't predict. Your carefully constructed plan
becomes noise in your head while you're trying to actually listen and connect.

The illusion of control gave you temporary relief from anxiety, but it didn't
actually give you control over the outcome, because you *can't* control the
outcome.

### Irony #2: control strategies can create the outcome you're trying to avoid.

Imagine you're dating someone new and feeling insecure about whether they're
genuinely interested. To avoid rejection, you start performing: being extra
agreeable, hiding your quirks, saying what you think they want to hear.
Eventually, they lose interest or pull away. Why? Because they never met the
real you. The person they're walking away from is the performance, not you. Your
strategy to avoid rejection manufactured an inauthentic connection that was
destined to fail.

## How to sail on the waves of life: a practice

### Step 1: notice when you're reaching for control

Get familiar with your personal control tells:

- Do you feel urgency to plan or research before you can move forward?
- Are you rehearsing conversations or interactions in your head?
- Do you feel like you're "on" or performing rather than just being?
- Are you trying to anticipate and prepare for every possible outcome?
- Do you feel like you can't relax until you've "figured it out"?

### Step 2: name the fear underneath

Ask yourself: *What am I afraid will happen if I don't control this?*

Common fears include:

- Being rejected or abandoned
- Looking foolish or incompetent
- Making the "wrong" choice and regretting it
- Being hurt or disappointed
- Missing an opportunity
- Discovering something painful about yourself or your situation

### Step 3: identify the safety you're actually seeking

What would "safety" look like here? Get specific:
- Do you need to feel safe to be vulnerable in a conversation?
- Safe to make a decision without knowing how it will turn out?
- Safe to be your authentic self even if someone doesn't like it?
- Safe to not have all the answers?
- Safe to be seen and potentially judged?
- Safe to enter into conflict even though it's uncomfortable?

### Step 4: build genuine safety that honors reality

Here's where the shift happens. Instead of building false safety through control, create real safety by:

**Grounding in what you actually can control:**

We mostly don't control outcomes at all, we can only influence them. But one
thing we do have control over is ourselves. How we relate to the world and its
events, how we frame our own emotions and experience.

Consider the things you have entirely within your control.

- "I can't control whether they'll like me, but I can control showing up as
  myself"
- "I can't control the outcome of this decision, but I can control gathering the
  information I need to make the best choice I can today"
- "I can't control their reaction, but I can control speaking my truth with
  kindness"

And sometimes you have no control over what happens at all. Illness strikes,
someone leaves, opportunities disappear, circumstances shift beyond your
influence. In those moments, your control lies entirely in how you relate to
what's happening:

- "I can't control this diagnosis, but I can control how I respond to it and
  what meaning I make from it"
- "I can't control that they left, but I can control how I process this loss and
  what I learn about myself"
- "I can't control this setback, but I can control what opportunities I look for
  within it"

Even when life deals you something you didn't choose and couldn't prevent, you
always retain complete control over your inner experience and how you navigate
what comes next. That's not a small thing; it's everything.

**Prepare yourself to handle any outcome:**

- "If they reject me, I'll be sad, but I'll be okay. I've survived rejection
  before"
- "If this doesn't work out, I'll adjust. I'm resourceful"
- "Whatever they say, I can handle hearing it"

**Reframe "unwanted" outcomes as valuable information:**

Even outcomes you wouldn't prefer contain something useful. The key is
recognizing that what feels like something being "done to you" is often actually
*information being revealed to you*.

- A date where you show up authentically and get rejected isn't "they rejected
  you"; it's discovering early that this wasn't a compatible match, saving you
  months or years of investing in something that wouldn't work
- A job that doesn't pan out isn't "you failed"; it's learning this role or
  company wasn't the right fit before you committed to the wrong place
- A conflict with a partner isn't something to avoid or smooth over; it's an
  opportunity to understand each other's true experience and build deeper
  connection. When you enter conflict authentically instead of managing it with
  control strategies (like performing calmness you don't feel, or planning the
  "right" way to bring something up), you create the possibility for genuine
  closeness. The discomfort of conflict is temporary; the understanding and
  intimacy that comes from it is what you actually want
  
Developing a muscle for finding the sometimes hard-to-see opportunities and
benefits in outcomes you *don't prefer* makes it possible to see all situations
as positives. It may be uncomfortable or emotionally challenging, but in those
moments you can find real, material growth.

**Practice willing acceptance:**

Not only must we recognize when things are outside of our control, we must also,
for the sake of our mental and spiritual health, *willingly accept them*. Energy
spent relitigating the past, wishing things could have been different, or
ruminating over the outcome you don't prefer is wasted.

The true and full freedom of sailing on these waves comes out of acceptance of
the way things are, because they are the way they must be. You've already done
all you can do, and now comes the real work: *let it go*.

- "Whatever happens is what must be"
- "The outcome that emerges from my authentic self is the genuine outcome"
- "I can't say the wrong thing to the right person"

### Step 5: redirect your energy to the present moment

Instead of living in a hypothetical future, bring yourself back:

- What can you appreciate about this moment?
- What sensations are you experiencing right now?
- What's one small thing you can do to engage more fully with what's in front of
  you?

## Examples in action

**The job interview:**

- *Control approach:* Obsessively research the company, script answers to every
  possible question, rehearse personality traits you think they want
- *Sailing approach:* Do reasonable preparation, then trust that the right fit
  will feel mutual. If you have to perform to get the job, you'll have to keep
  performing to keep it. Show up as yourself and trust that a mutual fit emerges
  on its own.

**The uncertain relationship:**

- *Control approach:* Play it cool to avoid seeming too interested. Analyze
  every text. Try to be whoever you think they want
- *Sailing approach:* Be honest about your interest and needs. Show up
  authentically. If your genuine self isn't what they're looking for, that's
  valuable information, not a failure. "You can't say the wrong thing to the
  right person."

**The big life decision:**

- *Control approach:* Research endlessly, create spreadsheets, try to guarantee
  you're making the "right" choice before you can move forward
- *Sailing approach:* Gather the information you reasonably can, acknowledge you
  can't know how it will unfold, and trust your ability to adapt to whatever
  happens

**The difficult conversation with a partner:**

- *Control approach:* Avoid bringing up what's bothering you, or carefully
  script how you'll say it to avoid conflict
- *Sailing approach:* Speak your truth with kindness, knowing that while the
  conversation might be uncomfortable, it's an opportunity to understand each
  other better and build deeper intimacy
  
Especially in conflict with a partner, also remember that the key to deepening a
connection is to be genuinely curious, even when what you are hearing is about
you, or critical of you. Understanding each other, especially when things are
not going well, is the solution to essentially all relationship struggles.

## The promise of sailing on the waves of life

When you stop trying to control outcomes and instead focus on being genuine in
the present, something shifts. You might not get every outcome you prefer, but
the outcomes you get are *real*. The connections are authentic. The paths
forward are true to who you actually are.

And paradoxically, by releasing control, you often get better outcomes. Because
you're not manufacturing artificial situations that collapse under their own
weight, you will only get outcomes that feel light and authentic.

The waves will always be unpredictable; that's the nature of life. But you can
learn to sail them with skill, intention, and grace. You have complete control
over your sails: your choices, your authenticity, your inner experience. That's
where your true power lies.

You find true personal freedom not in controlling life, but in trusting yourself
to navigate whatever life brings.
